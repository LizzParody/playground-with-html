#Cinderella

##The story of cinderella in my own words.

It was a dark and rainy night when the lady, Mrs. Roberta, gave birth to a beatufil blond baby girl called dulce. She chose that name because dulce means "sweet" in spanish, and Mrs. Roberta went to Medellin - Colombia when she was 15 and she loved the "dulce de leche" a Colombian dessert. But that's another part of the story.

The baby girl was healty and strong but Mrs. Roberta died that night unfortunatelly :( leaving the beautiful blond girl alone, but she was a happy and normal girl that talks with rats with pink dresses.
